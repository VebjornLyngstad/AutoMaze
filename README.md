## Description

The Auto Maze GUI is a graphical user interface designed to control and interact with an automated maze-solving system. The system uses an Arduino-based controller to manipulate actuators and sensors to navigate through mazes autonomously or under manual control.

The GUI offers three main modes of operation:
1. Manual Control: Allows the user to manually control the maze-solving system using an Xbox controller.
2. Auto Control: Enables the system to autonomously solve a detected maze using pre-defined maze-solving algorithms.
3. AI Control (Future Implementation): A mode that is currently under development, which will employ AI algorithms to optimize maze-solving strategies.
4. The project uses a Jetson Nano to run Python, the camera, and an Arduino 2560 Mega. The Arduino controls two actuators, one DC-motor, and one infrared sensor.

## Features

- User-friendly graphical interface.
- Manual control mode with Xbox controller support.
- Auto control mode for autonomous maze-solving.
- AI control mode (in development).
- Override mode to manually control actuators from the GUI.
- Automatic maze detection and display of detected maze information.
- Quit button to close the application.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter
- customtkinter
- pySerialTransfer
- opencv-python (cv2)
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using pip.
3. Connect the Arduino-based controller to the serial port specified in the GUI code (`serial_port = "/dev/ttyACM0"`). Make sure the controller is properly configured and communicating. (This is on Linux; it may be different on Windows or Mac.)

## Usage

1. Run the GUI application.
2. Upon startup, the main menu will be displayed, showing three buttons: "Manual," "Auto," and "AI" (currently not implemented). Click on the desired button to select the mode of operation.
3. In "Manual" mode, the Xbox controller should be connected to the system to control the maze-solving system manually.
4. In "Auto" mode, the system will automatically detect a maze (if present) and display the detected maze information. Click the "Run Auto Control" button to start the autonomous maze-solving process.
5. In "AI" mode (currently not implemented), AI algorithms will be used to optimize maze-solving strategies.
6. The "Override" button allows manual control of actuators from the GUI, regardless of the Xbox controller's presence.
7. The "MazeSolutions" folder contains text files with solutions for the different mazes, so they are always saved there. But if you would like to make a new solution or create other mazes, you can use the "WriteToFileWithTimestamp.py" program to make new solutions.

## Known Issues

- The AI mode is not yet implemented.
- It won't always start a connection with the Xbox controller when going into manual control.
- When clicking the "Return to Menu" button in manual control, it won't go back before getting an input from the Xbox controller.
- The GUI can open with the wrong graphics.
- The sensor is not perfectly calibrated, which can lead to the elevator going off or not going off when it is supposed to (occurs less than 1 percent of the time).
- The detection of the maze can struggle depending on the light; some filtering has been implemented to reduce the impact.
